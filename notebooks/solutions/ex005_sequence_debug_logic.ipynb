        "**Common misconceptions:**\n",
        "- Students forget to convert input to numbers\n",
        "- Using the wrong operator (`+` instead of `*`) completely changes the formula\n",
        "- Some may try to add parentheses unnecessarily; the default operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition) already gives the correct result\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reinforcement:** Always convert `input()` to the right type, and double-check that your formula uses the correct operators. You can add parentheses like `(celsius * 9 / 5) + 32` to make the order of operations clearer, even though they are not required here."
