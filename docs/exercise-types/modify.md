### Modification Exercise Formats

Modification exercises follow the debugging sets once pupils are confident with the construct in focus. Learners receive working code and must alter it to produce a new, fully specified output. Keep the progression gentle: begin with single-line tweaks, then layer in multi-line or multi-concept edits so the level of difficulty ramps gradually.

#### Notebook layout generated by the scaffolder

- Every exercise appears as a markdown / code cell pair.
- The markdown cell uses a heading of the form `## Exercise N — Title` and includes three subsections:
  - **Working code** shown inside a fenced `python` block.
  - **Task** describing the required change.
  - **Expected output** showing the exact stdout the tests check. Use plain fenced blocks so learners can copy the target result.
- The code cell directly underneath is the student workspace. It contains the unmodified working code and any guiding comments (for example, `# Exercise N — YOUR CODE`). There is **no separate execution cell** for the working solution; students edit this tagged cell in place.
- Cell metadata must include `{"language": "python", "tags": ["exerciseN"]}`. The grading helper `run_cell_and_capture_output()` in [tests/notebook_grader.py](tests/notebook_grader.py#L94) executes code by tag, so missing or misspelled tags will cause automated tests to fail.
- Exercises rely on printed output. Ensure the starter code already produces syntactically correct output so students focus on modification, not syntax errors.
- Optional extension or scratch cells (for self-checking) should be left untagged so the grader ignores them.

The snippet below reflects the structure emitted by the current scaffolding commands:

```json
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "metadata": { "language": "markdown" },
      "source": [
        "## Exercise 1 — Change the greeting",
        "",
        "**Working code:**",
        "```python",
        "print(\"Hello World!\")",
        "```",
        "",
        "**Task:** Modify the code so it prints `Hello Python!` instead.",
        "",
        "**Expected output:**",
        "```",
        "Hello Python!",
        "```",
        ""
      ]
    },
    {
      "cell_type": "code",
      "metadata": {
        "language": "python",
        "tags": ["exercise1"]
      },
      "source": [
        "# Exercise 1 — YOUR CODE",
        "# Modify the print statement below",
        "print(\"Hello World!\")"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tests such as [tests/test_ex002_sequence_modify_basics.py](tests/test_ex002_sequence_modify_basics.py) call each tagged cell and compare its stdout against the expected output shown in the markdown instructions. When adding new modification exercises, mirror this pattern so both the scaffolding CLI and the grading suite continue to work without adjustment.
