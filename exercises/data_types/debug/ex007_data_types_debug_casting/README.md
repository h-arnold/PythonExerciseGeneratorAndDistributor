## Student prompt
- Open the matching notebook in `notebooks/`.
- Fix the code in each cell tagged `exercise1`, `exercise2`, ...

## Teacher notes
- Created: 2026-02-11
- Focus: Casting between `str`, `int`, and `float`, and spotting where arithmetic or concatenation breaks.
- Keep students on simple, step-by-step conversions rather than compact one-liners.
