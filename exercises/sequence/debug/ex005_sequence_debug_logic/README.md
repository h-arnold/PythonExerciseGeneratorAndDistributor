# ex005: Sequence Debug Logic

## Metadata

- **ID**: ex005
- **Title**: Debug Logical Errors in Sequence Programs
- **Construct**: Sequence (basic input, output, calculations)
- **Type**: Debug
- **Difficulty**: Easy to Medium
- **Learning objective**: Identify and fix logical errors in simple sequential programs using only basic Python constructs (print, input, variables, arithmetic, string operations)

## Files

- **Notebook path**: `notebooks/ex005_sequence_debug_logic.ipynb`
- **Solution path**: `notebooks/solutions/ex005_sequence_debug_logic.ipynb`
- **Tests path**: `tests/test_ex005_sequence_debug_logic.py`

## Structure

This is a 10-part debugging exercise focusing on **logical errors** (not syntax errors):

- **Exercises 1-5**: Single logical error each (wrong operator, wrong variable, missing conversion, etc.)
- **Exercises 6-10**: Multiple logical errors (2-3 bugs per exercise)

## Common Bugs Covered

1. Wrong arithmetic operator (+ instead of *, / instead of *, etc.)
2. Using the wrong variable
3. Missing spaces in string concatenation
4. Forgetting to convert `input()` from string to int
5. Wrong order of operands in subtraction
6. Incorrect formula or missing terms in calculations
7. Printing the wrong variable

## Student Instructions

Students should:
1. Read the expected output
2. Run the buggy code to see what actually happens
3. Identify what's wrong
4. Fix the code
5. Write a brief explanation of the bug
6. Run tests to verify the fix
