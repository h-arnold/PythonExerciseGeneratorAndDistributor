# OVERVIEW — ex006_sequence_modify_casting

Prerequisites:
- Students should understand basic `print()` and variable assignment
- Familiarity with `input()` for reading text

Common misconceptions:
- Trying to add numeric strings without casting (e.g., "5" + "10" -> "510")
- Casting to the wrong type (e.g., casting to `int` when a `float` is required)

Hints for teachers:
- Demonstrate `int()` and `float()` conversions on short examples
- Show how `input()` always returns a `str` and must be cast before arithmetic

Worked example suggestions:
- Start with adding two numeric strings and casting them to int
- Show a case where float conversion is required (prices)

Teaching notes:
- Keep exercises small and focused — each modifies one line
- Encourage students to run one cell at a time to test their change
