# Solutions for Sequence Modify Variables (ex003)

1. Assign `greeting = "Hi there!"` so the print statement directly echoes the new value.
2. Change `subject` to "coding" and leave the rest of the string the same so the output becomes `I enjoy coding lessons.`
3. Set `food = "sushi"` before the print so the sentence reads `My favourite food is sushi`.
4. Add two input() calls: first for the fruit with prompt `Type the name of your favourite fruit:`, second for a descriptor with prompt `Type one word to describe it:`. The final print should be `print("I like " + fav_fruit + " because it is " + descriptor)` which outputs `I like mango because it is tropical` when given inputs `mango` and `tropical`.
5. Add two input() calls: first for the town with prompt `Which town do you like the most?`, second for the country with prompt `Which country is it in?`. The final print should be `print("I would visit " + town + " in " + country)` which outputs `I would visit Cardiff in Wales` when given inputs `Cardiff` and `Wales`.
6. Add two input() calls: first for first name with prompt `Please enter your first name:`, second for last name with prompt `Please enter your last name:`. The final print should be `print("Welcome, " + first_name + " " + last_name + "!")` which outputs `Welcome, Alex Morgan!` when given inputs `Alex` and `Morgan`.
7. Reassign `first_word = "Variables"` and `second_word = "matter"` to produce `Variables matter`.
8. Keep `part1 = "Keep"` and change `part2 = "experimenting"` so the final output is `Keep experimenting`.
9. Set `greeting = "Good"`, `time_of_day = "evening"`, and `audience = "everyone!"` so `print(greeting + " " + time_of_day + " " + audience)` prints `Good evening everyone!`.
10. Assign `part_one = "Variables"`, `part_two = "and strings"`, and `part_three = "make a message!"` so the concatenated result reads `Variables and strings make a message!`.
